# Carla_Controller
This is a Repository for the infinite horizon controller and the preview path tracking controller for Carla-Vehicle assets.
It also contains 6 custom maps, developed using RoadRunner VectorZero plugin and GIS data (topology-elevation data, satellite imagery 
and 3D lidar point clouds).

As an example, it spawns the AV and POAV at an intersection at times sampled from a gaussian distribution and records the intensity of a collision, if occured.
[Some function descriptions from the controllers missing to avoid plaigirism, since publication pending.]
