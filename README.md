# Carla_Controller
This is a Repository for the infinite horizon controller and the preview path tracking controller for Carla-Vehicle assets.
It also contains 6 custom maps, developed using RoadRunner VectorZero plugin and GIS data (topology-elevation data, satellite imagery 
and 3D lidar point clouds).
Additional scrips used to generation interaction sceanrios between Autonomous vehicle (AV) and Primary Other Autonmous Vehicle (POAV)
is also added. As an example, it spawns the AV and POAV at an intersection at times sampled from a gaussian distribution and records
the intensity of a collision, if occured.
