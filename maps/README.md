The <map>.tar.gz files are cooked maps, directly importable into newer versions of Carla (0.9.2 onwards), using the importmaps.sh shell script.
VectorZero RoadRunner plugin an Unreal Engine 4.21 was used to generation of maps and static assets. Elevation (topology) data, satellite imagery and 3D lidar point clouds, sourced from official USGIS data-source was used to generate maps for the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) campus, Pittsburgh; Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh and Northwest Pittsburgh, PA, USA.
